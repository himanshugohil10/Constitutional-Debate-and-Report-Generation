## Dummy Case Summary: Digital Surveillance & Mandatory Data Retention Policy, 2025

The Central Government introduced a **Digital Security and Data Retention Policy, 2025**, requiring all internet service providers and digital platforms operating in India to retain user metadata and communication logs for a minimum period of **five years**. The policy authorizes designated government agencies to access this data for purposes related to **national security, cybercrime prevention, and public order**, without prior judicial approval.

The policy applies uniformly to all users, irrespective of whether they are suspected of any wrongdoing. It does not clearly define the scope, safeguards, or procedural standards governing data access, nor does it provide a transparent mechanism for user notification or redress in cases of misuse. A group of citizens and digital rights organizations have challenged the policy, arguing that it violates the **right to life and personal liberty**, particularly the **right to privacy and dignity**.

They contend that the policy enables unchecked surveillance, lacks procedural fairness, and permits arbitrary State action. According to the petitioners, the blanket and prolonged data retention requirement is **disproportionate and unnecessary** for achieving the stated objectives.

The Government defends the policy by asserting that preventive surveillance and data retention are essential tools in combating **terrorism, cybercrime, and threats to national security**. The State argues that the policy serves a **legitimate public purpose**, is applied uniformly, and falls within the permissible limits of **reasonable regulation** in the interest of security and public order.

### Constitutional Questions Raised

* Whether mandatory long-term data retention violates **personal liberty and dignity**.
* Whether the absence of **judicial oversight** renders the procedure unfair and arbitrary.
* Whether the policy satisfies the **test of proportionality**.
* Whether uniform application without safeguards violates the guarantee of **equality before law**.
