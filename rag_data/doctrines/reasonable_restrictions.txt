Doctrine of Reasonable Restrictions

Fundamental rights are not absolute.
The State is allowed to impose restrictions on rights under Article 19.
Such restrictions must be reasonable and justified.
Courts examine whether the restriction serves a valid public purpose.
Unreasonable or excessive restrictions are unconstitutional.
