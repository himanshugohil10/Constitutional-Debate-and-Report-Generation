Doctrine of Chilling Effect

A law may indirectly discourage people from exercising their fundamental rights.
Fear of punishment or legal action can suppress lawful expression.
Even if a law does not directly prohibit speech, it may still have a chilling effect.
Courts consider this doctrine mainly in free speech cases under Article 19.
