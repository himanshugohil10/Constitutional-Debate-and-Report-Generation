Doctrine of Proportionality

This doctrine is used to test whether a restriction on a fundamental right is justified.
The restriction must have a legitimate objective.
There must be a rational connection between the restriction and the objective.
The restriction should be necessary and not excessive.
Courts use this doctrine mainly for Articles 19 and 21.
