Article 21 – Protection of Life and Personal Liberty

No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law.

Article 21 protects the right to life and personal liberty of all persons.
The right to life is not limited to mere existence and includes the right to live with dignity.

The procedure established by law must be fair, just, and reasonable.
Any arbitrary, oppressive, or unreasonable procedure violates Article 21.

Article 21 is closely connected with Articles 14 and 19 and is used to test the fairness and reasonableness of State action affecting life or liberty.
