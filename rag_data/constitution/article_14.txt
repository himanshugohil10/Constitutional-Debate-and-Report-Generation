Article 14 – Equality before Law

The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India.

Article 14 has two components:
1. Equality before law – absence of special privilege.
2. Equal protection of laws – equal treatment of similarly placed persons.

Article 14 prohibits arbitrary State action.
Arbitrariness and equality are considered opposites.

The State may classify persons or situations if:
• The classification is based on intelligible differentia, and
• There is a rational nexus with the objective sought to be achieved.

Article 14 is closely linked with Articles 19 and 21 and is used to test fairness, reasonableness, and non-arbitrariness of laws and State actions.
