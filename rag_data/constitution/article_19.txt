Article 19(1) guarantees the following freedoms to citizens:
(a) Freedom of speech and expression
(b) Freedom to assemble peacefully without arms
(c) Freedom to form associations or unions
(d) Freedom to move freely throughout the territory of India
(e) Freedom to reside and settle in any part of India
(g) Freedom to practice any profession or to carry on any occupation, trade, or business

These freedoms are not absolute.

Under Articles 19(2) to 19(6), the State may impose reasonable restrictions on these rights in the interests of:
• Sovereignty and integrity of India
• Security of the State
• Public order
• Decency or morality
• Contempt of court
• Defamation
• Incitement to an offence
• General public interest

Courts examine whether restrictions imposed on Article 19 rights are reasonable, necessary, and proportionate.
